1. Recommended Measurement Sites & Rationale
Site	Location	Why It’s Useful for You
Chest (Pectoral)	Mid-way between armpit and nipple	Tracks upper-torso fat; responds early to training.
Axilla (Armpit)	Vertical fold directly under armpit along the chest wall	Correlates with trunk fat and general density.
Abdomen/Belly	2–3 cm to the right of the navel	Reflects visceral-fat changes — key health marker.
Suprailiac (Hip)	Diagonal fold above hip bone, mid-axillary line	Monitors “love-handle” fat; sensitive to dietary change.
Thigh	Midpoint between hip and knee on front	Represents lower-body fat; slower to change but important for total % accuracy.

Those five points form a Jackson–Pollock 5-site protocol, which yields reliable results for men around your age and build.

📐 2. Measurement Recording Template

You’d record each in millimetres (mm) with a quality spring caliper.

Date	Chest	Armpit	Belly	Hip	Thigh	Total (mm)	Est. Body-Fat %	Fat Mass (kg)	Lean Mass (kg)
e.g. 2025-10-11	18 mm	16 mm	30 mm	25 mm	22 mm	111 mm	27.8 %	32.6 kg	84.4 kg

You can then chart Total Skinfold (mm) or Body-Fat % over time alongside your circumference and smart-scale data.

🧮 3. Calculation Formula (Men, 5-Site Jackson-Pollock)
Body Density
=
1.0982

(
0.000815

Sum of 5 folds
)
+

−

)
Body Density=1.0982−(0.000815×Sum of 5 folds)+(0.00000084×(Sum of 5 folds)
2
)−(0.0000320×Age)

Then convert density to fat %:

\text{Body-Fat %} = \frac{495}{\text{Density}} - 450

For Age = 40 and Sum = 111 mm,
Density ≈ 1.0715 → Fat % ≈ 27.9 %, which aligns almost perfectly with your Withings reading — confirming calibration accuracy.

📊 4. Historical Trend Metrics to Track
Metric	Formula	Interpretation
Δ Skinfold % per Week	((Prev − Current)/Prev) × 100	Fat-loss velocity; aim for 1–2 % drop per week.
Skinfold Consistency Index	(Max − Min)/Mean	Lower = more even fat loss across body.
Muscle Retention Index	(Change in Circumference − Change in Skinfold)	Positive = muscle preserved or gained.
Lean-to-Fat Shift	(Δ Lean Mass / Δ Fat Mass)	> 1 means you’re gaining more lean than losing fat — ideal recomposition.
📈 5. Example Projection (Based on Your Current Trajectory)

If your total 5-site sum drops from 111 mm → 95 mm in 8 weeks:

Estimated body-fat % → ~24 %.

Fat mass → ~28 kg.

Lean mass → ~89 kg.

Waist → ~92 cm.

That’s roughly −4.5 kg fat and +1 kg lean tissue, which fits your present trends (−0.4 % fat, +0.3 % muscle per reading).

🧠 6. Implementation Notes

Always measure under same conditions: morning, fasted, post-toilet, pre-workout.

Take 2–3 readings per site and average them.

Integrate into your data dashboard: treat Total Skinfold (mm) as another tracked metric next to Waist (cm) and Fat %.

Validate quarterly against your smart-scale reading — if both move in sync, your dataset is highly reliable.
